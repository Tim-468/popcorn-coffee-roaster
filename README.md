# popcorn-coffee-roaster

Turn your popcorn machine into a temperature-controlled coffee roaster

## TODO

- Test 24 V supply from AC/DC converter
- Remove diode bridge (or not?)
- Put a terminal block rated for Class II >= 340 V for 3x AC mains cables and 2x 24 V fan supply cables
- Somehow fit the WROOM32-D board inside the case (a right angle PCB header could maybe do it)
- Take photos to show required modifications and the assembly
- Test 1.5 mm diameter hole for 1 mm2 stranded wire
